## Setup for Other Devices

In order to support the webview, please follow Apple Guide [here](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/configure-app-capabilities/configure-sign-in-with-apple-for-the-web)

- Note for Step 7, you will need to setup a web server that can handle post request (i.e not Github Pages or other static host), check out the [example server posted](https://github.com/scottrules44/AppleSignIn_Web_Solar2D/tree/main/Express%20Server%20Example), all redirects will come as post requests to path "/apple_process_sign_in_solar2d" on your domain

- If you need to customize the domain path or UI, source code can be [here](https://github.com/scottrules44/AppleSignIn_Web_Solar2D/blob/main/plugin_appleSignIn.lua)


- You will then need to add credentials to the .show function
```lua
appleSignIn.show("nameAndEmail", function (e)
      print(json.encode(e))
end , { clientId = "tech.scotth.apple-sign-in", domain = "cloud.scotth.tech" }  )
```

## Build Settings
```lua
settings = 
{ 
    iphone = 
    { 
        entitlements = { 
            ["com.apple.developer.applesignin"] = {"Default"}, -- make sure provisioning profile supports Apple Sign In 
        } 
    }, 
    plugins = { 
        ["plugin.appleSignIn"] = 
        { 
            publisherId = "tech.scotth", 
            marketplaceId = "insert marketplace account ID", 
        }, 
    }, 
}
